This module contains code for testing and deploying the YOLO object detection network. The .cfg and .weights files are the parameters of the pre-trained model. The modular_testing directory contains code for implementation of real-time image data collection using the ZED stereo camera and simultaneous processing of the data by the YOLO network.
