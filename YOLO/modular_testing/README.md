This module contains code for the implementation of image collection and processing using YOLO. It is split up into 3 functions. controller.py is the function which needs to be ran. This will initialize the ZED camera and begin data collection. For each image collected, yolo.py will be called. This script handles the inferencing and post-processing of data. The processed data is then sent back to controller.py where the image is dipslayed with several overlays.

Before running, ensure you have the ZED Python SDK installed, and ZED camera connected. If you wish to use a different camera than the ZED, you can modify the script according to the test_yolo_2.py script one directory level up. Please note that using a different camera will cause the depth functionallity to give an error, so remove this part of the code or replace it with a dummy function.
